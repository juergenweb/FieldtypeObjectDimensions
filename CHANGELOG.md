# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.2] - 2023-06-14

This is the version that has been added to the ProcessWire module directory. The database scheme has been updated and a
lot of changes has been done to the code.
It has also been tested to work with the new PHP 8.2 version.

Another major change concerns the API calls. This version offers different API calls for different output formattings 
and 2 new methods to render combined strings. Please take a look in the docs. If you have an old installation, you have
to adapt the API calls to the new version.
