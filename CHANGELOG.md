# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.2] - 2023-06-14

This is the version that has been added to the ProcessWire module directory. The database scheme has been updated and a
lot of changes has been done to the code.
It has also been tested to work with the new PHP 8.2 version.

For users, which have downloaded a lower version before, have to uninstall the older version completely and to make a
fresh installation of this module. The most important reason for this is the database update.

Another major change concerns the API calls. This version offers different API calls for different output formattings
and 2 new methods to render combined strings. Please take a look in the docs. If you have an old installation, you have
to adapt the API calls to the new version.
