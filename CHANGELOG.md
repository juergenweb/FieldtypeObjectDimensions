# Change Log
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

## [1.2.2] - 2023-06-14

This is the version that has been added to the ProcessWire module directory. The database scheme has been updated and a
lot of changes has been done to the code.
It has also been tested to work with the new PHP 8.2 version.

For users, which have downloaded a lower version before, have to uninstall the older version completely and to make a
fresh installation of this module. The most important reason for this is the database update.
